<h1 align="center">My-Material-UI</h1>

Understand your components by your hands🔨. My-Material-UI is an adherent component library of [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui). To build beautiful [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) apps knowing what you are doing exactly, the most features from Material-UI are kept and My own ideas💡 are also poured in. Customizable, Readable and Helpful.

## Why I Make It🛵

*A good code warrior should excel at making tools at his/her will.*
Luckily I found a couple of splendid ui libraries such as Material-Ui and Vuetify when I dived into React&Vue.
I appreciated it that they provided me with plenty of good practices.
I realized I can't dive deeper unless I understand how they are built.
So I decided to make a "Material-Ui" with vue and a "vuetify" with react.
⚠️This is only for learning and guidance and hope you here could pick up something out of my work.🙃
